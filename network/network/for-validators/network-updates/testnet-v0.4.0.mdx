## Instructions for Node Operators

The testnet update is planned to go online at block height **11,000,000. **Node operators need to update their node software before that block height to avoid unexpected node behavior.

You can update your node version to v0.4.0 using Docker. The image tags are as follows:

* **For L2 nodes** - `l2geth:v0.4.0-1`
* **For DTL service** - `dtl:v0.4.0`

You can also find the updated Docker images here:

<Info>
If your node continues to sync normally after the node version update, you're good to go! Please [get in touch with us](https://discord.com/invite/0xMantle) if you encounter any issues during the process.
