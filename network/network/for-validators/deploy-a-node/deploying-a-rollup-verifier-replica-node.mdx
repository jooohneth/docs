title: "Deploying a Rollup Verifier/Replica Node"
description: Deploy a verifier node and sync rollup data as a part of Mantle network
---

<Warning>
Mantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new [documentation](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/)!

</Warning>

In order to build an app on Mantle network, you'll need access to a Mantle node. There are multiple public [Node RPC Providers](/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/node-rpc-providers) that you can choose from, or you can deploy your own depending on the requirements for your specific use cases.

## Running Your Own Node

<Warning>
If you run a node, please keep a close eye on the latest update on our [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle/releases) page

</Warning>

#### **Hardware Requirements**

Nodes need to store the transaction history of Mantle and run `l2geth`.

Recommended specs:

* **CPU** - min. 4 cores, 8th Gen. or higher
* **RAM** - min. 16 GB
* **Storage** - min. 100 GB disk space free (HDD works for now, SSD is better)
* **Bandwidth** - 10mb/s+ download

#### Approximate Disk Usage

Usage as of 2022-09-21:

* Archive node: \~800gb
* Full node: \~60gb

#### Snapshot

We recommend that you start the node with the latest [snapshot](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/networks/blob/main/run-node-mainnet.md#download-latest-snapshot-from-mantle), so that you don't need to wait a long time to sync data.

### Deployment

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Running the node by Docker">

The recommended method to create a replica is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the [Docker images we provide](https://hub.docker.com/u/mantlenetworkio). They include all the configuration settings. We use these images for our own systems, and as such they will be more thoroughly tested than any other configuration.

#### Node Configuration

You can find instructions to build and operate your node on Mantle testnet and mainnet by following the links below:

* [**Testnet node**](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/networks/blob/main/run-node.md)
* [**Mainnet node**](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/networks/blob/main/run-node-mainnet.md)

<Tab title="Running the node from binary">

To compile a Mantle node locally and participate in the network as a Verifier, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Go and C Compiler

Make sure Go (version 1.19) and a C compiler are installed on your system. You can use your preferred package manager (e.g., apt, yum, brew) to install them.

#### 2. Clone the Mantle Repository

Clone the Mantle GitHub repository using the following command:

```php
git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle.git
```

#### 3. Navigate to the `l2geth` Directory

Navigate to the `l2geth` directory within the Mantle repository:

```bash
cd mantle/l2geth
```

#### 4. Compile the Mantle Geth Node

Choose a stable release here and compile the Mantle Geth node using the Makefile with the following command:

```go
git checkout v0.4.3-5
make geth
```

#### 5. Setup the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/networks.git
cd networks
cd mainnet/envs
set -a
. ./geth.env
set +a 
mkdir ~/mantle_l2geth_data
cd ../..
export ETH1_HTTP=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth # change this
export SEQUENCER_CLIENT_HTTP=https://rpc.mantle.xyz
export ROLLUP_STATE_DUMP_PATH=https://mantlenetworkio.github.io/networks/mainnet/genesis.json
export ROLLUP_CLIENT_HTTP=https://dtl.mantle.xyz
export ROLLUP_BACKEND='l2'
export ETH1_CTC_DEPLOYMENT_HEIGHT=8
export RETRIES=60
export ROLLUP_VERIFIER_ENABLE='true'
export DATADIR=~/mantle_l2geth_data

cp ../mantle/l2geth/build/bin/geth .
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
```

<Info>
1. You need to change `ETH1_HTTP` to your own rpc
2. You need to change `DATADIR` to where you want to store data
3. If the sync speed is slow, try to change your DTL URL, you can check more details [here](/network/network/for-validators/deploy-a-node/deploying-a-rollup-verifier-replica-node#network-dtl-url).

</Info>

#### 6. Start as a Verifier

Start the node as a Verifier to join the Mantle network:

```sh
sh geth.sh
```

This command launches a local node configured as a Verifier to participate in the validation process within Mantle network.

## Appendix

### Network DTL URL

You can change the DTL service URL based on the network your node is going to connect to by updating the `ROLLUP_CLIENT_HTTP` value in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the Docker way and the `./mainnet/envs/geth.env` for the binary way.
