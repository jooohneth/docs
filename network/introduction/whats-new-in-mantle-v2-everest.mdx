After more than one year of stable operation of Mantle Tectonic, we proudly present the **Everest Upgrade**â€”a significant leap forward for the Mantle network. This upgrade not only strengthens our existing infrastructure but also prepares us fully for the upcoming **Ethereum Pectra Upgrade**, ensuring seamless compatibility with the Mantle network and laying a solid foundation for future development. As one of the core highlights of the Everest Upgrade, the official launch of **EigenDA** will introduce a revolutionary data availability solution to the network, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data management and security.

## Enhancements in Mantle v2 Everest Compared to Mantle v2 Tectonic

### EigenDA Integration

Mantle has maintained deep collaboration with EigenDA. Before EigenDA's mainnet launch, Mantle used Mantle DA (a third-party DA Layer powered by EigenDA) as its DA Layer. Therefore, when EigenDA went live, we immediately completed the migration on testnet and, after production environment testing, finally migrated on Mantle mainnet. For detailed information about EigenDA, please check [here](/network/system-information/off-chain-system/eigenda).

### L2 Adaptation for Ethereum Pectra Upgrade

Ethereum is about to welcome the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade. As an Ethereum L2, Mantle immediately began adaptation work for the changes brought by the Pectra upgrade, including the new `RequestsHash` field in block headers from EIP-7685, and the new `SetCodeTx` transaction type introduced in EIP-7702.

### New Feature Introduction

Since building on OP Stack Bedrock, Mantle has been committed to enhancing op-geth's functionality through extensibility development. In this upgrade, new RIP-7212 precompiled contract support was introduced, along with the addition of the `eth_getBlockReceipts` jsonRPC interface.

### MetaTX Feature Deprecation

MetaTX, independently developed by Mantle, provided gas fee sponsorship functionality, aiming to minimize barriers for users entering the Mantle ecosystem. With the introduction of EIP-7702 in the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, Mantle will provide the same gas fee sponsorship functionality based on it, therefore MetaTX will no longer be supported.[](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/whats-new-in-mantle-v2#enhancements-in-mantle-v2-tectonic-compared-to-mantle-v1)
